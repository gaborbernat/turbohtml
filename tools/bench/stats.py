"""
Statistics for a measurement repeated over rounds.

A robust estimate, plus enough spread to tell a real change from machine noise. A single pyperf mean is not enough to
compare two builds. Thermal drift, background load, and memory pressure move this
harness's numbers by tens of percent between rounds, which is larger than most changes worth shipping, so a lone
before/after pair can point either way on identical code. :func:`summarize` reduces repeated rounds to a median and the
dispersion around it, and :attr:`Summary.noisy` says whether that dispersion leaves room for a verdict at all. A caller
that gates on a noisy metric is reading the machine, not the change.
