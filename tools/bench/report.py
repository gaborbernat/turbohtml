"""
Render one operation's speedup table from a merged stats mapping.

Standard library only: the orchestrator imports this to print, so it must not pull in turbohtml or any competitor. A
benchmark name is ``"<operation>|<case>|<label>"`` and a stat is ``{"mean": seconds, "stdev": seconds}``; turbohtml is
the baseline every competitor column divides into. Each cell shows the mean, the relative standard deviation as ``±N%``
so a reader can tell a real gap from run-to-run noise, and (for competitors) the slowdown factor against turbohtml.

With ``--table-json DIR`` on the CLI, each rendered operation is also written to ``DIR/<operation>.json`` in the feed
the docs' ``bench-table`` directive consumes: the label, parties, metrics, and rows of raw mean seconds. A competitor
that threw on an input writes its message in place of the number, so the table can name why that cell is empty. The
directive derives the readable units and the ratios. These files are named for the operation, which is not what the
performance guide calls its tables, so do not copy them across by hand: :mod:`bench.docs_feeds` maps the two and writes
the committed feeds, and :mod:`bench.migration` does the same for the per-library migration feeds.
