/* XPath 1.0 over the turbohtml DOM (issue #179).

   This header is the seam between the engine and the rest of the module. The
   engine compiles a query string to an immutable program (a flat arena of tagged
   AST ops) once, then evaluates it many times against trees; the compiled program
   holds no tree pointers and no mutable state, so it is shareable across threads
   and lives in a per-handle cache like the CSS selector engine's.

   Phase 1 lands the front end only: the lexer and recursive-descent parser that
   build the arena AST, plus xp_dump for the conformance hook that the parser tests
   diff against. Evaluation and the Python xpath()/xpath_one() surface follow in
   later phases. */
