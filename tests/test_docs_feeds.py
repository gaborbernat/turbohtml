"""
Keep the performance guide's tables and the generator that writes them naming the same files.

:mod:`bench.report` emits one feed per operation, while ``docs/development/performance.rst`` names its tables for the
section they sit in, so :data:`bench.docs_feeds.TABLES` is the only thing tying the two together. When the guide gained
a table that the map did not know about, refreshing it meant copying files across by hand, and the committed feeds
drifted until they carried stale numbers and had lost competitor columns. These checks fail the moment the two sides
disagree again.
