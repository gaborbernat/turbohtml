"""
The measurement statistics the A/B comparison rests on.

These pin the properties that make a comparison trustworthy: the estimate must not drift with the round count, a wide
spread has to announce itself rather than pass as a result, and outliers are counted but never dropped, since dropping
them biases a comparison whenever the two sides drop a different number.
